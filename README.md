Description: The Customer Experience (CX) team of ABC plays a crucial role in managing inbound calls from existing and prospective customers. This project aims to understand the trends in call volume and derive valuable insights to optimize manpower allocation and improve customer experience.

We have been provided with a dataset spanning 23 days, containing details such as agent names and IDs, queue time, call time, call duration, and call status. By analyzing this data, we address questions related to average call duration, call volume analysis, manpower planning, and night shift manpower planning.
